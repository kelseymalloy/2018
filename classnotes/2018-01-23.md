## See second tuesday in lessonplans. 

Image clarifying relationships of 
  - 1. upstream master (MPO624/MPO624)
  - 2. personal fork (brianmapes/ATM624)
  - 3. local machine clone of fork (with yet a third name, potentially)
  
### Github's 223 client is the central glue holding it all together! 
## Must use it to get 1. into 2. (via 3.)
