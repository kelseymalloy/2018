# Assignments for basic statistics.

1. Operate the _distributions_ notebook, learn its lessons, study how it works.

2. From the File menu, Make a copy and then Rename it. 

3. Bring your own data into at least 2 of the notebook's plots. **This will require some study of data input methods!** You could take examples from other notebooks (like one of the Unidata ones) for now... but this will be the crucial area where homework becomes projects, so choose examples that relate to your project work (like netCDF files, for most of you -- unidata-workshop has examples of that). 

4. Clean up the notebook for showing in class. Just 2 favorite plots is fine. Delete unneeded cells (with the scissors). Be careful! Upper cells affect lower cells. For instance, you will clearly need to retain all the **import** statements, in order to have the same packages. You have to understand the flow of the code before lopping out parts of it.  

5. To make it a final prouct, add Markdown cells at the bottom, plot titles, and other forms of reader-friendly text, to explain what you learned about your data (that is, about the world) from this exercise. In other words, bring the technical activity back to science in the end. It can be a small thing, especially in the first (_distributions_) example.
